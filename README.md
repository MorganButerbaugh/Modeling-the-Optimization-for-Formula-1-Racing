This project uses both Python and Lingo.

Leveraging Formula 1 race data retrieved and stored within the Python library ‘fastf1’, we can construct simulation modules to predict optimal 
tyre strategies for the average Formula 1 team during a Grand Prix race. These modules incorporate data on tyre degradation, considering lap times 
as a function of tyre age (number of laps run), alongside data on pit stop time loss. By analyzing data related to the various tyre 
compounds and their corresponding lap times, degradation coefficients and baseline parameters for each compound are established. 
Subsequently, these values are implemented within mathematical models designed to estimate total race time and optimal tyre usage, including the 
number of pit stops and corresponding stint lengths.
